Mapty Application for Running using location API


Welcome to the Mapty application. This application was designed and developed during Jonas Schmedtmanns JavaScript course. This application helps individuals keep track of their running and cycling. This application showcases my knowledge in Javascript fundamentals as well as using API. When the app starts, it will ask if it's ok to use your current location, and by clicking yes, the application will sync to your current location using API data. Click anywhere on the map to bring up the input field on the left. Within this field, you can do things like cycle between running and cycling and input the distance, duration, and steps per min. Thank you for checking this out; I will be implementing more things as time moves along.
